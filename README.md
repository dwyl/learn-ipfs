# Learn IPFS

Learn how to use IPFS to build decentralised &amp; distributed "Web 3.0" application!

# _Why?_

The [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)
was designed to be decentralised network
that could survive and continue functioning in the event of a
natural or man-made disaster destroying _part_ of the network.

While the _Network_ is distributed and thus resilient to failure,
the vast majority of _content_ is still served by centralised servers.
The founders/creators of the Interned designed the Network and protocols
for routing requests across the network,
but they did not create a means
of distributing and serving content from multiple nodes.

## Concentration of Power, Censorship and the Filtered Web

From the earliest days of the World Wide Web,
there emerged content hubs

# What?

This tutorial will take you through the basics of creating
content and publishing it on IPFS,
but first we need a bit of background knowledge/recap.

> **Note**: if you are already familiar with any of this,
feel free to skim/skip it and go straight to the "How?" section.

## What are Centralised, Decentralised and Distributed Networks ?

In a **centralised** network there is a central node that controls communication between all nodes.
A **decentralised** network is a series of interconnected hubs. If one hub goes down only the nodes connected to that hub will be affected, the rest of the network will still continue to function.
The internet is an example of a decentralised network. It is resilient against failure of several hubs.

If the central node in a _centralised_ network goes offline, all communication is disrupted.
In a decentralised network, one "hub" can be offline and the rest of the network can still communicate.

A ***distributed*** network is the most resilient type or ["topology"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology). In a distributed network any single node can completely fail and the remaining nodes will still be able to communicate.

# Notes, References & Further Reading

+ Internet Wikipedia article is great place to start your journey
of understanding the Internet. The article is comprehensive and well-maintained:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet ... the beauty of reading the
Wikipedia article is that whenever you don't understand a term, you can
click or search for it's definition on the web. If you're reading this
offline, you know _exactly_ why the distributed web is _necessary_!
